      "for an account of its structure and etymology see appendix\n",
      "was startlingly different from any other object in sight\n",
      "it was an enormous pyramidal structure of glittering white concrete soaring up terrace after terrace 300 metres into the air\n",
      "from where winston stood it was just possible to read picked out on its white face in elegant lettering the three slogans of the party war is peace freedom is slavery ignorance is strength the ministry of truth contained it was said three thousand rooms above ground level and corresponding ramifications below\n",
      "scattered about london there were just three other buildings of similar appearance and size\n",
      "so completely did they dwarf the surrounding architecture that from the roof of victory mansions you could see 1984 all four of them simultaneously\n",
      "they were the homes of the four ministries between which the entire apparatus of government was divided\n",
      "the ministry of truth which concerned itself with news entertainment education and the fine arts\n",
      "the ministry of peace which concerned itself with war\n",

      "there were no windows in it at all\n",
      "winston had never been inside the ministry of love nor within half a kilometre of it\n",
      "it was a place impossible to enter except on official business and then only by penetrating through a maze of barbedwire entanglements steel doors and hidden machine gun nests\n",
      "even the streets leading up to its outer barriers were roamed by gorilla faced guards in black uniforms armed with jointed truncheons\n",
      "winston turned round abruptly\n",
      "he had set his features into the expression of quiet optimism which it was advisable to wear when facing the telescreen\n",
      "he crossed the room into the tiny kitchen\n",
      "by leaving the ministry at this time of day he had sacrificed his lunch in the canteen and he was aware that there was no food in the kitchen except a hunk of dark coloured bread which had got to be saved for tomorrow's breakfast\n",
      "he took down from the shelf a bottle of colourless liquid with a plain white label marked victory gin\n",
      "it gave off a sickly oily smell as of chinese rice spirit\n",
      "winston poured out nearly a teacupful nerved free ebooks at planet ebook\n",
      "com himself for a shock and gulped it down like a dose of medicine\n",
      "instantly his face turned scarlet and the water ran out of his eyes\n",
      "the stuff was like nitric acid and moreover in swallowing it one had the sensation of being hit on the back of the head with a rubber club\n",
      "the next moment however the burning in his belly died down and the world began to look more cheerful\n",
      "he took a cigarette from a crumpled packet marked victory cigarettes and incautiously held it upright whereupon the tobacco fell out on to the floor\n",
      "with the next he was more successful\n",
      "he went back to the living room and sat down at a small table that stood to the left of the telescreen\n",
      "from the table drawer he took out a penholder a bottle of ink and a thick quarto sized blank book with a red back and a marbled cover\n",
      "for some reason the telescreen in the living room was in an unusual position\n",
      "instead of being placed as was normal in the end wall where it could command the whole room it was in the longer wall opposite the window\n",
      "to one side of it there was a shallow alcove in which winston was now sitting and which when the flats were built had probably been intended to hold bookshelves\n",
      "by sitting in the alcove and keeping well back winston was able to remain outside the range of the telescreen so far as sight went\n",
      "he could be heard of course but so long as he stayed in his present position he could not be seen\n",
      "it was partly the unusual geography of the room that had suggested to him the thing that he was now about to do\n",
      "but it had also been suggested by the book that he had 1984 just taken out of the drawer\n",
      "it was a peculiarly beautiful book\n",
      "its smooth creamy paper a little yellowed by age was of a kind that had not been manufactured for at least forty years past\n",
      "he could guess however that the book was much older than that\n",
      "he had seen it lying in the window of a frowsy little junk shop in a slummy quarter of the town just what quarter he did not now remember and had been stricken immediately by an overwhelming desire to possess it\n",
      "party members were supposed not to go into ordinary shops dealing on the free market it was called but the rule was not strictly kept because there were various things such as shoelaces and razor blades which it was impossible to get hold of in any other way\n",
      "he had given a quick glance up and down the street and then had slipped inside and bought the book for two dollars fifty at the time he was not conscious of wanting it for any particular purpose\n",
      "he had carried it guiltily home in his briefcase\n",
      "even with nothing written in it it was a compromising possession\n",
      "the thing that he was about to do was to open a diary\n",
      "this was not illegal nothing was illegal since there were no longer any laws but if detected it was reasonably certain that it would be punished by death or at least by twentyfive years in a forced labour camp\n",
      "winston fitted a nib into the penholder and sucked it to get the grease off\n",
      "the pen was an archaic instrument seldom used even for signatures and he had procured one furtively and with some difficulty simply because of a feeling that the beautiful creamy paper deserved to be written on with a real nib instead of being scratched with an ink pencil\n",
      "actually he was not used to free ebooks at planet ebook\n",
      "com writing by hand\n",
      "apart from very short notes it was usual to dictate everything into the speak write which was of course impossible for his present purpose\n",
      "he dipped the pen into the ink and then faltered for just a second\n",
      "a tremor had gone through his bowels\n",
      "to mark the paper was the decisive act\n",
      "in small clumsy letters he wrote april 4th 1984\n",
      "he sat back\n",
      "a sense of complete helplessness had descended upon him\n",
      "to begin with he did not know with any certainty that this was 1984\n",
      "it must be round about that date since he was fairly sure that his age was thirty nine and he believed that he had been born in 1944 or 1945\n",
      "but it was never possible nowadays to pin down any date within a year or two\n",
      "for whom it suddenly occurred to him to wonder was he writing this diary\n",
      "for the future for the unborn\n",
      "his mind hovered for a moment round the doubtful date on the page and then fetched up with a bump against the newspeak word doublethink\n",
      "for the first time the magnitude of what he had undertaken came home to him\n",
      "how could you communicate with the future\n",
      "it was of its nature impossible\n",
      "either the future would resemble the present in which case it would not listen to him or it would be different from it and his predicament would be meaningless\n",
      "for some time he sat gazing stupidly at the paper\n",
      "the telescreen had changed over to strident military music\n",
      "it was curious that he seemed not merely to have lost the pow1984 er of expressing himself but even to have forgotten what it was that he had originally intended to say\n",
      "for weeks past he had been making ready for this moment and it had never crossed his mind that anything would be needed except courage\n",
      "the actual writing would be easy\n",
      "all he had to do was to transfer to paper the interminable restless monologue that had been running inside his head literally for years\n",
      "at this moment however even the monologue had dried up\n",
      "moreover his varicose ulcer had begun itching unbearably\n",
      "he dared not scratch it because if he did so it always became inflamed\n",
      "the seconds were ticking by\n",
      "he was conscious of nothing except the blankness of the page in front of him the itching of the skin above his ankle the blaring of the music and a slight booziness caused by the ginsuddenly he began writing in sheer panic only imperfectly aware of what he was setting down\n",
      "his small but childish handwriting straggled up and down the page shedding first its capital letters and finally even its full stops april 4th 1984\n",
      "last night to the flicks\n",
      "all war films\n",
      "one very good one of a ship full of refugees being bombed somewhere in the mediterranean\n",
      "audience much amused by shots of a great huge fat man trying to swim away with a helicopter after him first you saw him wallowing along in the water like a porpoise then you saw him through the helicopters gunsights then he was full of holes and the sea round him turned pink and he sank as suddenly as though the holes had let in the water audience shouting with laughter freeebooksatplanetebook\n",
      "com 11 when he sank then you saw a lifeboat full of children with a helicopter hovering over it\n",
      "there was a middle aged woman might have been a jewess sitting up in the bow with a little boy about three years old in her arms little boy screaming with fright and hiding his head between her breasts as if he was trying to burrow right into her and the woman putting her arms round him and comforting him although she was blue with fright herself all the time covering him up as much as possible as if she thought her arms could keep the bullets off him\n",
      "then the helicopter planted a 20 kilo bomb in among them terrific flash and the boat went all to matchwood then there was a wonderful shot of a child's arm going up up up right up into the air a helicopter with a camera in its nose must have followed it up and there was a lot of applause from the party seats but a woman down in the prole part of the house suddenly started kicking up a fuss and shouting they didnt oughter of showed it not in front of kids they didnt it aint right not in front of kids it aint until the police turned her turned her out i dont suppose anything happened to her nobody cares what the proles say typical prole reaction they winston stopped writing partly because he was suffering from cramp\n",
      "he did not know what had made him pour out this stream of rubbish\n",
      "but the curious thing was that while he was doing so a totally different memory had clarified itself in his mind to the point where he almost felt equal to writing it down\n",
      "it was he now realized because of this other incident that he had suddenly decided to come 1984 home and begin the diary today\n",
      "it had happened that morning at the ministry if anything so nebulous could be said to happen\n",
      "it was nearly eleven hundred and in the records department where winston worked they were dragging the chairs out of the cubicles and grouping them in the centre of the hall opposite the big telescreen in preparation for the two minutes hate\n",
      "winston was just taking his place in one of the middle rows when two people whom he knew by sight but had never spoken to came unexpectedly into the room\n",
      "one of them was a girl whom he often passed in the corridors\n",
      "he did not know her name but he knew that she worked in the fiction department\n",
      "presumably since he had sometimes seen her with oily hands and carrying a spanner she had some mechanical job on one of the novel writing machines\n",
      "she was a bold looking girl of about twenty seven with thick hair a freckled face and swift athletic movements\n",
      "a narrow scarlet sash emblem of the junior anti sex league was wound several times round the waist of her overalls just tightly enough to bring out the shapeliness of her hips\n",
      "winston had disliked her from the very first moment of seeing her\n",
      "he knew the reason\n",
      "it was because of the atmosphere of hockey fields and cold baths and community hikes and general clean mindedness which she managed to carry about with her\n",
      "he disliked nearly all women and especially the young and pretty ones\n",
      "it was always the women and above all the young ones who were the most bigoted adherents of the party the swallowers of slogans the amateur spies and nosers out of unorthofree ebooks at planet ebook\n",
      "com doxy\n",
      "but this particular girl gave him the impression of being more dangerous than most\n",
      "once when they passed in the corridor she gave him a quick sidelong glance which seemed to pierce right into him and for a moment had filled him with black terror\n",
      "the idea had even crossed his mind that she might be an agent of the thought police\n",
      "that it was true was very unlikely\n",
      "still he continued to feel a peculiar uneasiness which had fear mixed up in it as well as hostility whenever she was anywhere near him\n",
      "the other person was a man named o'brien a member of the inner party and holder of some post so important and remote that winston had only a dim idea of its nature\n",
      "a momentary hush passed over the group of people round the chairs as they saw the black overalls of an inner party member approaching\n",
      "o'brien was a large burly man with a thick neck and a coarse humorous brutal face\n",
      "in spite of his formidable appearance he had a certain charm of manner\n",
      "he had a trick of resettling his spectacles on his nose which was curiously disarming in some indefinable way curiously civilized\n",
      "it was a gesture which if anyone had still thought in such terms might have recalled an eighteenth century nobleman offering his snuffbox\n",
      "winston had seen o'brien perhaps a dozen times in almost as many years\n",
      "he felt deeply drawn to him and not solely because he was intrigued by the contrast between o'brien's urbane manner and his prize fighter's physique\n",
      "much more it was because of a secretly held belief or perhaps not even a belief merely a hope that o'brien's political orthodoxy was not perfect\n",
      "something in his face suggested it irresistibly\n",
      "1984 and again perhaps it was not even unorthodoxy that was written in his face but simply intelligence\n",
      "but at any rate he had the appearance of being a person that you could talk to if somehow you could cheat the telescreen and get him alone\n",
      "winston had never made the smallest effort to verify this guess indeed there was no way of doing so\n",
      "at this moment o'brien glanced at his wrist watch saw that it was nearly eleven hundred and evidently decided to stay in the records department until the two minutes hate was over\n",
      "he took a chair in the same row as winston a couple of places away\n",
      "a small sandy haired woman who worked in the next cubicle to winston was between them\n",
      "the girl with dark hair was sitting immediately behind\n",
      "the next moment a hideous grinding speech as of some monstrous machine running without oil burst from the big telescreen at the end of the room\n",
      "it was a noise that set one's teeth on edge and bristled the hair at the back of one's neck\n",
      "the hate had started\n",
      "as usual the face of emmanuel goldstein the enemy of the people had flashed on to the screen\n",
      "there were hisses here and there among the audience\n",
      "the little sandy haired woman gave a squeak of mingled fear and disgust\n",
      "goldstein was the renegade and backslider who once long ago how long ago nobody quite remembered had been one of the leading figures of the party almost on a level with big brother himself and then had engaged in counter revolutionary activities had been condemned to death and had mysteriously escaped and disappeared\n",
      "the programmes of the two minutes hate varied from day to day but there was free ebooks at planet ebook\n",
      "com none in which goldstein was not the principal figure\n",
      "he was the primal traitor the earliest defiler of the party's purity\n",
      "all subsequent crimes against the party all treacheries acts of sabotage heresies deviations sprang directly out of his teaching\n",

      "it was intended that when newspeak had been adopted once and for all and oldspeak forgotten a heretical thought that is a thought diverging from the principles of ingsoc should be literally unthinkable at least so far as thought is dependent on words\n",
      "its vocabulary was so constructed as to give exact and often very subtle expression to every meaning that a party member could properly wish to express while excluding all other meanings and also the possibility of arriving at them by indirect methods\n",

      "it was intended only to express simple purposive thoughts usually involving concrete objects or physical actions\n",

      "the first of these was an almost complete 378 1984 interchangeability between different parts of speech\n",

      "even where a noun and verb of kindred meaning were not etymologically connected one or other of them was frequently suppressed\n",
      "there was for example no such word as cut its meaning being sufficiently covered by the noun verb knife\n",
      "adjectives were formed by adding the suffix ful to the noun verb and adverbs by adding wise\n",
      "thus for example speedful meant rapid and speedwise meant quickly\n",
      "certain of our presentday adjectives such as good strong big black soft were retained but their total number was very small\n",
      "there was little need for them since almost any adjectival meaning could be arrived at by adding ful to a noun verb\n",

      "it was also possible as in presentday english to modify the meaning of almost any word by prepositional affixes such as ante post up down etc\n",
      "by such methods it was found possible to bring about an enormous diminution of vocabulary\n",
      "given for instance the word good there was no need for such a word as bad since the required meaning was equally well indeed better expressed by ungood\n",

      "a word which was difficult to utter or was liable to be incorrectly heard was held to be ipso facto a bad word\n",

      "compound words such as speakwrite were of course to be found in the a vocabulary but these were merely convenient abbreviations and had no special ideologcal colour\n",
      "they consisted of two or more words or portions of words welded together in an easily pronounceable form\n",

      "but the special function of certain newspeak words of which oldthink was one was not so much to express meanings as to destroy them\n",

      "what was required in a party member was an outlook similar to that of the ancient hebrew who knew without knowing much else that all nations other than his own worshipped false gods\n",
      "he did not need to know that these gods were called baal osiris moloch ashtaroth and the like probably the less he knew about them the better for his orthodoxy\n",

      "he knew what was meant by goodsex that is to say normal intercourse between man and wife for the sole purpose of begetting children and without physical pleasure on the part of the woman all else was sexcrime\n",
      "in newspeak it was seldom possible to follow a heretical thought further than the perception that it was heretical beyond that point the necessary words were nonexistent\n",
      "no word in the b vocabulary was ideologically neutral\n",

      "so far as it could be contrived everything that had or might have political significance of any kind was fitted into the b vocabulary\n",
      "the name of every organization or body of people or doctrine or country or institution or public building was invariably cut down into the familiar shape\n",
      "that is a single easily pronounced word with the smallest number of syllables that would preserve the original derivation\n",
      "in the ministry of truth for example the records department in which winston smith worked was called recdep the fiction department was called ficdep the teleprogrammes department was called teledep and so on\n",
      "this was not done solely with the object of saving time\n",
      "even in the early decades of the twentieth century telescoped words and phrases had been one of the characteristic features of political language\n",
      "and it had been noticed that the tendency to use abbreviations of this kind was most marked in totalitarian countries and totalitarian organizations\n",
      "examples were such words as nazi gestapo comintern inprecorr agitprop\n",
      "in the beginning the practice had been adopted as it were instinctively but in newspeak it was used with a conscious purpose\n",
      "it was perceived that in thus abbreviating a name one narrowed and subtly altered its meaning by cutting out most of the associations that would otherwise cling to it\n",
      "the words communist international for instance call up 386 1984 a composite picture of universal human brotherhood red flags barricades karl marx and the paris commune\n",
      "the word comintern on the other hand suggests merely a tightly knit organization and a well defined body of doctrine\n",
      "it refers to something almost as easily recognized and as limited in purpose as a chair or a table\n",
      "comintern is a word that can be uttered almost without taking thought whereas communist international is a phrase over which one is obliged to linger at least momentarily\n",
      "in the same way the associations called up by a word like minitrue are fewer and more controllable than those called up by ministry of truth\n",
      "this accounted not only for the habit of abbreviating whenever possible but also for the almost exaggerated care that was taken to make every word easily pronounceable\n",
      "in newspeak euphony outweighed every consideration other than exactitude of meaning\n",
      "regularity of grammar was always sacrificed to it when it seemed necessary\n",
      "and rightly so since what was required above all for political purposes was short clipped words of unmistakable meaning which could be uttered rapidly and which roused the minimum of echoes in the speaker's mind\n",
      "the words of the b vocabulary even gained in force from the fact that nearly all of them were very much alike\n",
      "almost invariably these words goodthink minipax prolefeed sexcrime joycamp ingsoc bellyfeel thinkpol and countless others were words of two or three syllables with the stress distributed equally between the first syllable and the last\n",

      "com 387 speech at once staccato and monotonous\n",
      "and this was exactly what was aimed at\n",
      "the intention was to make speech and especially speech on any subject not ideologically neutral as nearly as possible independent of consciousness\n",
      "for the purposes of everyday life it was no doubt necessary or sometimes necessary to reflect before speaking but a party member called upon to make a political or ethical judgement should be able to spray forth the correct opinions as automatically as a machine gun spraying forth bullets\n",
      "his training fitted him to do this the language gave him an almost foolproof instrument and the texture of the words with their harsh sound and a certain wilful ugliness which was in accord with the spirit of ingsoc assisted the process still further\n",
      "so did the fact of having very few words to choose from\n",
      "relative to our own the newspeak vocabulary was tiny and new ways of reducing it were constantly being devised\n",
      "newspeak indeed differed from most all other languages in that its vocabulary grew smaller instead of larger every year\n",
      "each reduction was a gain since the smaller the area of choice the smaller the temptation to take thought\n",
      "ultimately it was hoped to make articulate speech issue from the larynx without involving the higher brain centres at all\n",
      "this aim was frankly admitted in the newspeak word duckspeak meaning to quack like a duck\n",
      "like various other words in the b vocabulary duckspeak was ambivalent in meaning\n",

      "they followed the same grammatical rules as the words in the other two vocabularies\n",
      "very few of the c words had any currency either in everyday speech or in political speech\n",
      "any scientific worker or technician could find all the words he needed in the list devoted to his own speciality but he seldom had more than a smattering of the words occurring in the other lists\n",
      "only a very few words were common to all lists and there was no vocabulary expressing the function of science as a habit of mind or a method of thought irrespective of its particular branches\n",
      "there was indeed no word for science any meaning that it could possibly bear being already sufficiently covered by the word ingsoc\n",
      "from the foregoing account it will be seen that in newspeak the expression of unorthodox opinions above a very low level was well nigh impossible\n",
      "it was of course possible to utter heresies of a very crude kind a species of blasphemy\n",
      "it would have been possible for example to say big brother is ungood\n",

      "in 1984 when oldspeak was still the normal means of communication the danger theoretically existed that in using newspeak words one might remember their original meanings\n",
      "in practice it was not difficult for any person well grounded in doublethink to avoid doing this but within a couple of generations even the possibility of such a lapse would have vaished\n",
      "a person growing up with newspeak as his sole language would no more know that equal had once had the secondary meaning of politically equal or that free had once meant intellectually free than for instance a person who had never heard of chess would be aware of the secondary meanings attaching to queen and rook\n",
      "there would be many crimes and errors which it would be beyond his power to commit simply because they were nameless and therefore unimaginable\n",

      "when oldspeak had been once and for all superseded the last link with the past would have been severed\n",
      "history had already been rewritten but fragments of the literature of the past survived here and there imperfectly censored and so long as one retained one's knowledge of oldspeak it was possible to read them\n",

      "in his mind shortly before 5\n",
      "00 o'clock in the morning soon the dream would be terminated by the alarm frank was on a walk through a sunny valley\n",
      "but even at this beautiful place the moldy smell was still pervasive so that frank wondered how such a beautiful valley could smell so repulsive\n",
      "when the alarm clock rang it quickly became clear that the sunny valley was just fantasy although the smell was real\n",
      "the noise was shrill and frank awoke swearing\n",
      "now he had to get up put on his clothes have a hasty breakfast and walk to the production complex 42 b\n",
      "damn\n",
      "hissed the unshaven man as he moved his not excessively tall but amazingly strong body from his cheaply produced bed\n",
      "hmmmhaaa\n",
      "yawned frank shuffling through his still dark apartment to the next room where a dirty kitchen was waiting for him\n",
      "the citizen tore open the refrigerator door and chocked down a cheese sandwich the meager leftovers from yesterday's supper\n",
      "the water kettle was started with a loud whoosh and after a few minustes supplied hot water for a cup of instant coffee\n",
      "nnnhhaa\n",
      "uttered the young man a statement that could be interpreted in many ways at this early hour and could have referred to his life situation in general\n",
      "at 5\n",
      "27 o'clock frank closed the battered door behind himself and walked listlessly down the dark corridor on his way to descend the even darker stairway\n",
      "the source of that foul stench that had been torturing frank's nose for days was somewhere here\n",
      "perhaps one of the other tenants damn idiot had left his garbage in the corridor\n",
      "j don't know\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "as kohlhaas always said\n",
      "in the past years he had learned to hate his life\n",
      "he was 25 years old now living in a more than shabby flat on the outskirts of the former frg capital berlin working for modest wages as a temporary help in a steel plant\n",
      "in former times he had wanted to study but this issue was over for reasons that frank never mentioned\n",
      "actually he was not dumb but according to his own words he couldn't hack it yet\n",
      "however the job at the steel plant was better than nothing because it gave him the chance to earn some money and to survive an advantage that was not enjoyed by millions of germans in the year 2027\n",
      "as he now groped along again on this particular morning step by step towards the plant he passed demolished houses in the twilight and crowds of homeless people lying in masses in the dark corners of the streets\n",
      "what would be if i simply didn't care about the consequences and went home again got back into my bed and just slept until tomorrow\n",
      "he thought sometimes\n",
      "what would it be like if i just packed my bags and disappeared from this rotten city this scruffy country\n",
      "he asked himself occasionally\n",
      "but where was it any different\n",
      "he should enjoy what he had he'd got a job and didn't go hungry\n",
      "that was at least something thought frank\n",
      "after the worker had gone through a very long and dark underpass without giving a globe coin to the drunken beggar there the production complex came into frank's vision\n",
      "it was 5\n",
      "53 in the morning and the workers for the early shift stood there waiting smoking jawing\n",
      "when the factory gates finally opened at 6 o'clock about 200 workers poured through them like a viscous mash\n",
      "most of them were not in any rush to begin their work but it had to be there was no other way\n",
      "no alternative\n",
      "as frank always said\n",
      "after ten hours they went back home again\n",
      "all were dirty and tired but happy that the work was over for the day\n",
      "frank crept through the corridor on his floor which was still dim even by day and unlocked the door of his apartment\n",
      "there were no new messages on the scanchip and that was good because it were usually only calculations electricity water and such things\n",
      "frank had placed the television in his bedroom the day before so if he couldn't fall asleep he could turn it on\n",
      "the program did not interest him but with the sound of anyone talking he didn't feel so alone in this dark block of flats\n",
      "kohlhaas just knew his neighbours from brief encounters\n",
      "many of them only left their apartments to go to work and some of them had become serious boozers in recent years\n",
      "from time to time someone would bawl from his balcony or accosted people passing his block but after a while everyone was sleeping\n",
      "citizen 1 564398b 278843 watched television till 22\n",
      "37 o'clock the news war of the global armed forces against dangerous terrorists in iran talk shows easy entertainment on all fronts warnings of the second dog flu epidemic and the necessity for the immediate compulsory inoculation\n",

      "since approximately half a year the production complex administration had arranged the singing of the one worldsong due to a new international regulation before every lunch time in each production complex for the increase of work moral and to strengthen the international doctrine of peace freedom prosperity and equality that was propagated by the world government since 2018\n",
      "the official of the ministry for production supervision stationed in this enterprise mr. gert sasse who was mostly in his office above the factory building had conscientiously come down to the workers to sing the one world song with them\n",

      "the smell had not been liquidated by anyone against the spirit of the age\n",
      "only in the early morning hours he had been able to sleep for a while because of his constant brooding and the unpleasant thoughts that had tortured him during the night\n",
      "as first thought of the new grey day the face of mr. sasse appeared in his head and the face of citizen 1 564398b278843 changed to a hateful grimace when he mused about killing the official with an iron rod\n",

      "even if frank screwed up his eyes this unnatural brightness besieged his barricaded head persistently like an army\n",

      "as nothing in big eye was within his power\n",
      "he was nothing but a white mouse here a small laboratory rat in a cage that had to endure everything the sadistic inventors of this so called mental hospital had invented\n",

      "a human being which is human by overcoming its humanity\n",

      "occasionally the prisoner lost orientation because the sharp light was like a white nebula\n",
      "frank tried to fight the pain in his head but he was at this cell's mercy\n",

      "but god didn't hear him\n",
      "the acoustic insulation of the holo cell was much too perfect deep down in the prison complex big eye\n",

      "at night at 22\n",
      "00 o'clock the sharp light was switched off\n",
      "the whole room suddenly became dark then\n",
      "so pitch dark that even the smallest source of light did not remain\n",
      "frank couldn't see 36 the hand before his eyes anymore and in his head the aftereffects of the blinding blaze jumped around as manifold colors\n",

      "whoever had developed the concept of this instrument of torture knew exactly that this cruel form of conditioning could transform even the unruliest man to a willing slave within only a short time\n",

      "you are one of the prototypes\n",
      "support the developers of this new form of healing by helping your therapy to success\n",
      "it resounded through the room one morning\n",
      "on other days patient 111 f 47 was explained how important it was to believe everything the media told him\n",
      "how necessary it was to free human beings from their instincts to format and reprogram their minds so that they could overcome all their natural instincts\n",
      "furthermore how inevitable the sedation of human beings was so that they could reach a state of happiness\n",
      "how important 37 consumption and maximization of profit were for a functioning society\n",
      "in these long weeks of isolation the strange artificial days and the black unnatural nights it was frank's largest concern not to go insane\n",
      "the isolation the boredom and above all the haunting light had soon transformed him into a pathetic creature\n",
      "he often thought about his father and his sister the only members of his family who were still there\n",
      "frank's mother had died three years ago he had loved her very much and with her death he had lost not only his biological mother but also his best friend his closest reference person in this world\n",

      "now nobody was left to talk to\n",
      "to his father rainer kohlhaas who lived in the eastern part of berlin frank had had only irregular contact\n",
      "rarely too rarely he had visited him so far if he was honest\n",
      "but rainer kohlhaas was an unemotional taciturn man and each discussion with him was laborious\n",
      "frank and rainer had frequently argued in former times\n",
      "often the father had openly shown his displeasure about frank's path through life and had always upholded frank's sister martina as the positive example\n",
      "his son had hated these permanent comparisons but now all this was no longer important\n",
      "from time to time he had telephoned with his older sister the more successful one of the two children\n",
      "martina had become a teacher had married and frank had often envied her because of her good payment\n",
      "but one day she had confessed to him how fraught and exhaustive her job was\n",
      "she just hated to work on her school\n",
      "she teached the subjects biology and\n",
      "\n",
      "english at a school complex in wuppertal in the sub district westfalenrheinland\n",
      "martina described the situation in german 38 schools as more than intolerable and frank had the suspicion that she already drank and took tranquilizers\n",
      "but she held on for her husband and her son the little nico\n",
      "however citizen 1 564398b 278843 had seen his nephew only twice and had always been proud to be his uncle\n",
      "in these terrible days he often thought about the rest of his family which probably didn't know at all that he was locked up here\n",
      "perhaps they would only be surprised about the fact that frank didn't answer the telephone since weeks\n",
      "perhaps the police had even informed his family members that he had become an offender and was a criminal now and had to face his fair punishment in that prison\n",
      "he just didn't know but he could imagine his father's face if he got that message\n",
      "j have always said that the boy wastes his life\n",
      "now my old sorrow has finally been confirmed\n",
      "he had probably murmured\n",
      "the prisoner didn't try to think too much about these unpleasant things\n",
      "what has happened to my apartment\n",
      "he pondered\n",
      "l'm sure that they have already rented it to another person\n",
      "this can be done fast if the rent can't be deducted from the scanchip anymore\n",
      "in these days frank could only speak with himself and tried to handle the pain\n",
      "but it did not change anything\n",
      "he had served only one month in this room but frank already got the feeling that he had walked from one end of hell to the other\n",
      "it was not easy to persevere here\n",
      "and the daily two reeducation hours finally became even the most interesting things which happened on a day in the holo cell\n",
      "after a while frank occasionally even looked forward to them\n",
      "nevertheless sometimes he tried to destroy the loudspeaker which hung much too high to tear it down\n",
      "then he became so angry that he kicked against the walls 39 or bit in his underarm till it bled\n",
      "frank's lonely fight against windmills continued for a while in such a way\n",
      "always unsuccessful and ever more closer to the loss of his good judgement\n",
      "sometimes he cried below the loudspeaker begged for grace and forgiveness and promised to follow each rule and each regulation for all eternity\n",
      "he swore to believe everything what they told him\n",
      "but nobody ever answered\n",
      "when two months had passed frank broke out in tears ever more frequently or crawled under his light gray plank bed\n",
      "he thought that insanity had already found him and skid down into a state of permanent panic\n",
      "patient 111 f 47 didn't trust his own judgement any longer and felt seperated from the rest of the world like by a great ocean\n",
      "in the second month of his term of imprisonment he made insanity to his companion\n",
      "he invisaged him as another inmate as a cellmate\n",
      "a very tall guy gaunt with completely pale skin and deep furrows in the face\n",
      "also dressed in the correct white cell clothes of big eye\n",
      "however if the insanity sat beside him on the plank bed he unfortunately never answered\n",
      "he just sneered at him showing kohlhaas his yellowish brown teeth\n",
      "but nevertheless frank told his spooky friend a lot of things\n",
      "sometimes the patient also imagined that mr. madness as frank called him after a while snored in the complete darkness of the night lying somewhere in the room\n",
      "then he crept over the ground and tried to find his strange cellmate in order to tell to him that he might be silent\n",
      "frank thought about much confusing things and nobody could say if the young men still knew that it were confusing things\n",
      "it was a nocturnal trip beyond the borders of human understanding a mental journey through the darkest tunnels 40 of his mind\n",
      "and every morning kohlhaas was awaked by that bright hellish light again\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "that's the army of the light particles which destroys my lids with their ramming supports piece by piece pouring into my head fortress with loud screams slaughtering everything without further warning\n",
      "and this cruel horde massacres my helpless grey cells\n",
      "said the young man if he could hardly bear it\n",
      "then he had phases in which he searched his body on diseases for hours\n",
      "he found malicious knots and parasites everywhere\n",
      "his body seemed to be full of degenerated pimples and strange maladies under the skin which filled his mind with sorrows\n",
      "at the end of the third month he discovered some red points on the white wall behind the toilet when he huddled on the ground in order to protect himself against the aggressive light\n",
      "frank was sure that it were traces of blood which had only provisionally been overcoated with white color by the prison's staff\n",
      "mr. madness had no opinion about this he just sat in the corner and beheld frank sadly\n",
      "often kohlhaas remembered whether it was actually possible to smash his own head against the wall or the ceramic toilet bowl so hardly that this torture was over\n",
      "what would happen\n",
      "would the attendants save him just to let him rot here until doomsday\n",
      "another possibility was to bite open his pulse veins\n",
      "unfortunately there were no bedlinen or other things in this cell which would have made a suicide possible\n",
      "but each time when frank had these thoughts he finally lost the courage to do it\n",
      "moreover mr. madness always looked worriedly at him in these situations still sitting in his corner\n",
      "the light disappeared it was 22 00 o'clock\n",
      "starting from the fourth month of his captivity in the holo cell frank kohlhaas spent the most days with being just 41 motionless for hours lying on his belly under the plank bed\n",
      "may this damn light hit mr. madness\n",
      "may he sit on the plank bed\n",
      "i will stay here\n",
      "here that blaze will never find me\n",
      "he said to himself with a lunatic smile\n",
      "meanwhile frank thought about his family more rarely\n",
      "and what was the use anyhow\n",
      "he was separated from the rest of the world\n",
      "and his father his sister or the little nico could not safe him from this horror\n",
      "and as the computer controlled woman voice had already explained in one of the reeducation hours the connections to family and kinship are errors of nature and all citizens of the new world order must get along without them\n",
      "they must be corrected by modern rules\n",
      "interhuman relations harm the new order and obstruct the economic development\n",
      "humans must learn to overcome them\n",
      "having a family is not progressive it restrains every advancement\n",
      "forget your family because your new community is the community of the one world\n",
      "you are part of the whole patient 111 f 47 and the whole is a part of you\n",
      "his only entertainment in this confusing time was to examine the dust grains on the cell ground and frank wondered how many interesting forms and colors he could find\n",
      "sometimes it was really fascinaiting for him and so he hardly listened if the gentle voice of reeducation from the loudspeaker explained to him why the old order of the world was just wrong and the new order was good without exception\n",
      "when the fifth month began frank suddenly became talkative\n",
      "he talked with mr. madness about a lot of things and often his speeches lasted several hours\n",
      "he invented lectures which were similar to the instructions of the 42 reeducation hours\n",
      "meanwhile frank planned to reeducate mr. madness a very important personality who had already visited millions of people around the world\n",
      "sometimes he preached the most important facts of each current reeducation hour he recited them yelled them and sometimes he tried to kick or beat mr. madness if his pupil didn't show enough interest\n",
      "although he actually viewed this gentleman in the corner who sometimes also sat on his plank bed as his cell comrade and friend he had occasionally to give some pain to him so that he learned\n",
      "but all his attemps to hit the imaginary man were unsuccessful\n",
      "after a while frank had kicked a little hole in the white wall of the holo cell but he had never hit mr. madness\n",
      "when another month had passed frank had given it up to convince mr. madness to become also a good citizen of the new world state\n",
      "now he tried to memorize every single word of the reeducation hours and often he could completely repeat the first two or three minutes by heart\n",
      "he cried sang and howled the slogans from the loudspeaker like a parrot\n",
      "the necessity of the registration of earth's population the obligation of obeying the autoregulation of economics the inevitability of a society without sexes nations and races the necessary dissolution of all cultures and religions the requirement of inhumanity as the basis of a new humanity\n",
      "his memory proved although it was already owergrown by a mushroom of insanity as amazingly good\n",
      "frank saw himself as a learner and with bloodshot eyes he cried while the loudspeaker talked jawohl\n",
      "this is the only truth\n",
      "43 meanwhile half a year had passed and patient 1 1 1 f 47 had developed many possibilities of overcoming the hours and days\n",
      "he had even set up an own daily plan in his mind meal learn as much words from the reeducation hour as i can explain them to mr. madness however only if he listened investigate the fibers of the white wallpaper more exactly finding new dust particles on the ground lunch arguing with mr. madness frank's meal rations came through a hatch in the wall three times a day\n",
      "the inventors of the holo cell had kindly made certain that he had never to leave this terrible room not even for the intake of food\n",
      "two months later the monitoring cameras of big eye which always kept every corner in this big prison complex in sight including room 47 in block f saw a broken man lying like dead with face down on his plank bed\n",
      "frank kohlhaas patient 111 f 47 seemed to have slipped into an endless lethargy\n",
      "meanwhile he wished nothing more than the end of his shattered existence\n",
      "the cruel treatment had internally destroyed him and even the irrational behavior and the emotional outbreaks which had kept him alive for so long were over\n",
      "over eight months of holo cell had corroded his mind so strongly that his body seemed to refuse its service any longer under such inhuman conditions\n",
      "the sharp malicious light which tormented him 14 hours a day hand in hand with the impenetrable darkness of the artificial nights had finally crushed frank's will to live\n",
      "the holo cell 47 in block f this hell chamber without windows 44 with only a plank bed a toilet and a little hatch in the white wall was ultimately the winner in this war against insanity\n",
      "not even frank's only friend the mutely smiling mr. madness had had the guts to stay here any longer he had vanished\n",

      "03\n",

      "the unconscious frank kohlhaas who layed somewhere in this cell down on the ground with his face in a puddle of saliva was swallowed by the darkness again\n",
      "he did no longer notice it\n",
      "the next day the army of light particles started another great attack on frank's head\n",
      "with loud crashing it surged against his lids like a battering ram and awoke the halfdead patient again\n",
      "but frank's will was already destroyed and why should he be interested in another day of hundreds more in this holo cell\n",
      "he hoped with the still smoldering rest of his understanding that he would meet death as soon as possible\n",
      "kohlhaas was sure that he would praise the grim reaper like a redeemer when he would finally come\n",

      "the small part of his brain which hadn't been razed to the ground and hadn't been brunt by the horde of light particles yet was briefly surprised for a second about the fact that there was another announcement after the wake up call\n",
      "then frank's mind switched off again\n",

      "indeed alf lived in a hovel if it was his house at all\n",
      "however his housemate seemed not to be here\n",
      "the young 62 man walked over some old wood stairs to the upper floor where he found only a few empty and poorly furnished rooms\n",
      "one of them was full of cardboards and wooden boxes almost up to the ceiling\n",
      "but alf baumer was nowhere to be found\n",
      "where am i here at all\n",
      "thought frank and scratched his head\n",
      "since the escape from big eye he hadn't been in the condition to think about these strange men who had rescued him\n",
      "who were they\n",
      "he opened the entrance door of the house and stepped outside left it open a bit so that he could come back again because he had no key for the ramshackle door\n",
      "when he looked down the street in which alf s house was kohlhaas saw a lot of further hovels on each side\n",
      "some of the houses seemed to be empty others had weathered fronts and in the gardens a sprouting uncontrolled growth was spreading everywhere\n",
      "some of the windows had been nailed up with rotted boards probably long ago\n",
      "one house had even a collapsed roof\n",
      "in addition here and there one of the houses had been renovated again and frank heard the voices of children out of a side street\n",
      "he could even understand their language it was german\n",
      "nevertheless the sun shone on all the roofs whether desolate or repaired again\n",
      "but many people didn't seem to live in this rundown village\n",
      "finally frank saw two men who unloaded crates out of a delivery van\n",
      "a tractor rattled somewhere in the distance and a mature woman leaned out of the window in the house opposite to him\n",
      "frank walked down the road and came to a square which probably must had been the center of the small village in former times\n",
      "weed sprouted out of the cracks between the 63 cobblestones which covered the whole place\n",
      "here in the center of this ghost town frank could see three old houses with big shopwindows\n",
      "two of the large windows were broken and the buildings looked dilapidated\n",
      "the shopwindow of the other house was completely plastered with yellow cellotape\n",
      "in the center of the square was a memorial stone completely overgrown with all sorts of grass and bushes\n",
      "it was surrounded by a wooden fence\n",
      "kohlhaas could hardly recognize the memorial stone and apart from this the inscription on it was in cyrillic so that the man from central europe could not read anything\n",
      "on the stone a soldier with a helmet and a rifle was shown\n",
      "nevertheless frank had already seen this helmet from the old time in a history book\n",
      "furthermore he was able to decipher the years which had been engraved on the memorial stone 1941 and 1989\n",
      "the young man continued his walk and regarded a moldered church which stood next to the village square\n",
      "its roof was damaged and had enormous holes bricks covered with moss and lichens lay in front of the rotten wooden front door that was adorned with a hardly recognizable picture\n",
      "on the tower was a rusted cross of iron\n",
      "the winged thing on the door of the church which was completely overgrown with lichens was probably an angel that had symbolically welcomed the people at the entrance of the church in the old times\n",
      "but in a world that had been left alone by god perhaps even this angel had lost his job one day\n",
      "frank pushed the large wood door to the side and climbed over a pile of planks in order to reach the inner part of the old church\n",
      "dried out leaves dirt and dust were everywhere on the ground in front of him\n",
      "the benches of the old building were dirty and everything made the impression of being lost\n",
      "the altar was also damaged and had small tears and cracks 64 probably because of the cold of a hard winter\n",
      "the visitor finally turned his head towards the ceiling and examined the wooden frescos on the walls which also showed traces of decomposition\n",
      "frank beheld some angels that were fighting against strange looking demons or something like that creatures from hell\n",
      "other frescos depicted mother maria and jesus christ\n",
      "the superstar of christianity\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "said frank to himself and smiled cynically\n",
      "this church appeared old and somehow also sublime\n",
      "the chapel had possibly been built in the late middle age but frank did not know it for sure\n",
      "he knew nothing about history\n",
      "but the young man didn't care about the age of this church\n",
      "only one thing was true the building touched his inner self although he never had believed in anything\n",
      "maybe just because it was beautiful and old\n",
      "in his previous world he had never beholden an old building\n",
      "gray plattenbauten dirty streets underpasses and factories were nothing new to him but he had never looked at old churches or castles\n",
      "this house of god was just like a memorial of a forgotten time\n",
      "a time far beyond this dark age\n",
      "the church had probably been the heart of this village for many decades or even centuries\n",
      "at this place the people had prayed to a higher power begging it to take care of them\n",
      "but in the end it all had come differently\n",
      "in the year 2028 mankind was alone and frank had never noticed a higher power that wanted to protect its children\n",
      "father if you exist at all why have you left us\n",
      "said frank quietly to himself and looked at the fragile ceiling of the old building again\n",
      "then he went back to the square\n",
      "he walked through the hopeless village for several hours\n",
      "again and again up to the other end and back\n",
      "around the 65 locality were fields and forests and only a muddy street seemed to connect it with the rest of the world\n",
      "the young man sat down on a bank and looked at the sky when three little children probably those who he had already heard before in the side street ran across the road in front of him\n",
      "they briefly examined him and smiled but frank didn't take heed of them\n",
      "somewhere a dog barked in a house which looked inhabited\n",
      "he stood up and passed some vacant rundown houses\n",
      "this village the renegate citizen had already forgotten its name was a bleak place as kohlhaas thought\n",
      "nevertheless he prefered this village to the rotten former frg capital berlin his old home\n",
      "he wouldn't miss the criminality the cultural and racial tensions and all the decay that was typical for the shabby metropolis where he had grown up\n",
      "now he was here\n",
      "in this strange hicktown\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "lvas\n",
      "now frank remembered the name of the village\n",
      "alf had said it several times\n",
      "ivas somewhere in lithuania\n",
      "but what was this for a strange village\n",
      "frank kohlhaas was puzzled\n",
      "meanwhile he was tired and his shoes were completely covered with mud\n",
      "he finally decided to return to alfs house because the front door was still open although it was improbable that the other villagers would steal from them\n",
      "it was not like in berlin\n",
      "soon the day came to an end\n",
      "frank didn't know yet where he was here\n",
      "ln three days we must leave this house frank\n",
      "i must leave it too because it is doesn't belong to me explained baumer after a meager lunch\n",
      "as i already guessed\n",
      "whose house is it\n",
      "lt belongs to another villager who is currently in minsk to buy some things answered baumer\n",
      "wilden has said that we can live here for a few days\n",
      "if the owner comes back 66 home we can surely move to one of the other vacant houses in the village\n",
      "what is that for a odd village\n",
      "murmured frank\n",
      "wilden will explain it to you tomorrow\n",
      "actually he already wanted to talk to you today but you were not here\n",
      "you took a little walk isn't it\n",
      "said alf whose tiredness meanwhile shone in his eyes\n",
      "tell me where are you from baumer\n",
      "asked frank suddenly\n",
      "well i was born in dortmund and have lived in some other cities in the ruhrgebiet also in frankfurt am main for four years said alf and took another tea\n",
      "why have they brought you to big eye\n",
      "frank became curious\n",
      "my god you ask a lot\n",
      "but well you will have to remain here in ivas this is hopefully obvious to you and therefore i will tell you a few things about me\n",
      "alfred baumer decided to make another camomile tea and went to the boiler\n",
      "then he fetched a cigarette and began with a small lecture about his life\n",
      "frank actually didn't want to know all the details but alf seemed to look forward to a little speech\n",
      "now he was awake again\n",
      "j had troubles with the authorities since my 16th year of life\n",
      "i was active in various political groups which you don't know as i think\n",
      "anyhow they are all forbidden since many years\n",
      "i have already been in jail for one year in 2013 when the political system of the frg still existed\n",
      "they have punished me for so called opinion crimes because i have designed a few internet sites which were uncomfortable for the state\n",
      "at that time i was just 19 years old\n",
      "my parents have lost their jobs during the great world economic crisis in 2012 13 and have jettisoned me after my term of imprisonment\n",
      "i 67 have never returned back home again\n",
      "afterwards i have lived with some friends in various housing groups and of course also alone\n",
      "after six years in 2020 i have joined the red moon groups always trying to live inconspicuously\n",
      "nevertheless it has gone wrong\n",
      "the red moon groups\n",
      "frank looked surprised\n",
      "they were terrorists isn't it\n",
      "these guys have burned a hospital in berlin right\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "that's nonsense\n",
      "lies\n",
      "grumbled alf and gave frank an annoyed glance\n",
      "l'm sorry\n",
      "they have said it on television at that time remarked frank and tried to calm down his comrade\n",
      "on television\n",

      "\n",
      "on television\n",
      "\n",

      "didn't you understand this yet\n",
      "grunted baumer and felt accused wrongly\n",
      "no offense meant\n",
      "apologized kohlhaas\n",
      "no it is a lie frank\n",
      "the red moon groups publicy protested against the world government and united thousands of young people in their fight\n",
      "opponents of globalization free philosophers patriots and others\n",
      "after that damn hospital hoax which the media exaggerated with all their might we were criminalized\n",
      "it had been the work of the gsa the international secret service there is no doubt for me\n",
      "it has not been activists of our group\n",
      "however the following crusade of the international media broke the neck of the red moon organization\n",
      "tell me why should a group of freedom fighters burn innocent people in a hospital\n",
      "asked alf with visible rage\n",
      "do you see the tattoo on my neck\n",
      "this is the red moon the blood red moon of the fight for liberty our old symbol\n",
      "l don't know enough about all this and i don't care\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "said frank\n",
      "l only know that i hate that goddam world 68 government that terrible system from the bottom of my heart\n",
      "then ivas is the right place for you my friend\n",
      "said alf and stared at his tea cup clenching his fist\n",
      "and then\n",
      "asked frank\n",
      "then\n",
      "then i was still active\n",
      "after the red moon groups were forbidden worldwide we continued our struggle in the underground\n",
      "finally i was arrested during an illegal spontaneous demonstration which i have organized with some of my comrades\n",
      "i had to go to jail again\n",
      "my time in big eye began and i can be glad that they did not find other loading material during the house search at that time otherwise i would have been liquidated\n",
      "what material\n",
      "questioned kohlhaas\n",
      "alfred baumer looked at him and shook his head\n",
      "you ask very much for a man who still was flat on his face a few hours ago\n",
      "never mind\n",
      "that would have made me more than just some problems believe me\n",
      "so i was sentenced to nine years of detention only because of the spontaneous demonstration\n",
      "i would have never endured that\n",
      "in my time as an activist of the red moon groups i became also aquainted with some of these weird guys from here\n",
      "they have already told me years ago that i should escape from the sector central europe to come with them to lithuania\n",
      "nevertheless i was not willing to give up the fight in my homeland because it was my aim to liberate it from this global insanity\n",
      "today i say to myself that it was just stupid to wait for so long\n",
      "it would have been wiser to leave central europe in time because the great enemy is much too strong in the west\n",
      "well now you are here\n",
      "and me too\n",
      "the best thing that could happen to us baumer\n",
      "this fucked up sector central 69 europe shall go to hell it shall rot forever\n",
      "hissed frank and wiped off some tea drops from his lip\n",
      "we must not let our compatriots go to the hell\n",
      "it is our country\n",
      "no we are not on vacation here\n",
      "we just relocate our fight\n",
      "we will only surrender when the maggots corrode us in our graves\n",
      "answered alfred and put his foot down\n",
      "frank was astonished and observed his partner who snatched the teapot with a loud curse\n",
      "we are not on vacation here\n",
      "frank was surprised about this statement his housemate had shouted out with so much passion\n",
      "what did alf mean by that\n",
      "again frank kohlhaas slept well and firmly\n",
      "he had amazingly regenerated himself in this short time\n",
      "sometimes he even felt euphoric\n",
      "l am not even afraid of the devil\n",
      "he thought then and smiled proudly\n",
      "but it was not that simple\n",
      "the aftereffects of the holo cell were far more malicious than he could imagine and they were still there deep in the dark corners of his brain\n",
      "they just lay in wait and planned to erupt in order to strangle frank's peace of mind while he was sleeping\n",
      "like the mourning after the death of a beloved person usually comes in waves it was the same with the mental horror the holo cell had unleashed in frank's mind\n",
      "the dread had only entrenched itself and waited now in its fortified position for the signal to attack frank again\n",
      "no the fright wasn't gone\n",
      "but in these first days of his new freedom kohlhaas had a peaceful time so far\n",
      "the rain pattered on the corrugated iron roof of the small shed in front of frank's window and the untiring noise made him wake up\n",
      "it was already after ten o'clock on this 70 wet morning and the young man rolled from one end of the bed to the other\n",
      "suddenly alf entered the room and said good morning frank\n",
      "please get up\n",
      "wilden is here and he would like to talk to you\n",
      "the village boss already sat in the kitchen and sipped his coffee\n",
      "he welcomed frank friendly and told him to follow him to his house after the breakfest\n",
      "somehow the situation was unpleasant for frank but he tried to avoid problems and obeyed\n",
      "we must talk about some things kohlhaas\n",
      "remarked the leader of the village community who wore a long gray coat and a hat with a narrow brim\n",
      "the rain had softened the muddy roads of the village and frank waded behind the somehow authoritarian and impressive mr. wilden through the dirt\n",
      "after a short foot march they finally came to an amazingly well renovated house which was even surrounded by a beautiful garden\n",
      "we go upstairs\n",
      "said wilden\n",
      "the former entrepreneur sat down behind an adorned desk of dark wood and remained silent for some minutes\n",
      "frank took a seat on a soft armchair of black imitation leather which smelled cleaned\n",
      "he looked around\n",
      "the room seemed to be an office and was in a perfect condition\n",
      "everywhere he could see pictures on the wall with the light brown wallpaper battle paintings framed photos of some great men from the old times and a lot of other things\n",
      "well frank kohlhaas\n",
      "do you like our village\n",
      "asked the gray haired man smiled and tried to take the uncertainty from his young guest\n",
      "nice\n",
      "was frank's short answer\n",
      "nice\n",
      "repeated wilden soberly\n",
      "j want to make it short and i will not talk around the bush said the village boss and looked out the window\n",
      "71 then he continued this village is called ivas\n",
      "it is in the area of the former state of lithuania in the southwest part of this actually beautiful country\n",
      "it is small and insignificant\n",
      "a small village that has been abandoned by its former inhabitants under the pressure of the worldwide economic collapse some years ago\n",
      "a ghost town as you may know them from north america\n",
      "aha\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "said frank\n",
      "this village is so small and so unimportant that even the sharpest eye must look twice to see it explained wilden\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "therefore i am safe here\n",
      "joked frank\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "well security is relative\n",
      "particularly in our time mr. kohlhaas\n",
      "above all nowadays\n",
      "said the host quietly\n",
      "but here\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "remarked frank\n",
      "as i already said frank kohlhaas interrupted him wilden\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "today it is a benediction to be safe\n",
      "you are here in ivas an insignificant village in an also not excessively important country in eastern europe\n",
      "this village is so unimportant that even the big eye the eye which can see the whole world and always wants to see more did not notice it yet\n",
      "do you know what this village really is frank\n",
      "no\n",
      "just tell it to me\n",
      "frank reacted nervously\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "then i want to explain it to you exactly\n",
      "where you are here and with whom you are here\n",
      "answered the man with a serious look\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "this is no usual village in the contemplative lithuania and we are no holiday community\n",
      "we are rebels who fight against the world government\n",
      "ivas is one of our bases\n",
      "some of our men live here with their families or alone\n",
      "a few of these ramshackle houses i had acquired for relatively small sums from the former lithuanian state in the period of its dissolution\n",
      "finally my fellows and me settled in this abandoned village\n",
      "some more men will still come 72 and we will establish our position here\n",
      "but there is one important rule everybody has to be quiet\n",
      "frank wondered\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "rebels against the world government\n",
      "he thought and beheld wilden with surprise\n",
      "l think i know what you mean\n",
      "he said then\n",
      "you came to ivas and you will stay here\n",
      "we can't let you go because you already know too much and this is a safety risk\n",
      "even if you tell just one single word about us and this village we must kill you\n",
      "i say it to you not as your foe\n",
      "this is the situation in which you are frank kohlhaas\n",
      "spoke wilden and nodded\n",
      "and believe me we will not hesitate to wack you immediately if you endanger our group\n",
      "he said with a cold voice\n",
      "l understand\n",
      "frank was more than confused\n",
      "but i don't want to threaten or frighten you my friend\n",
      "you had suffered enough and i wish you a good recovering here\n",
      "furthermore i don't want to force you to join us\n",
      "just trust alf he is a man with a pure heart and could even become a good friend to you\n",
      "moreover he bailes for you and told me that you are a nice person said wilden and smiled again\n",
      "l want to rest as a start and then i will take a look at your organization\n",
      "and believe me i'm really grateful because you saved my life\n",
      "don't worry i would never betray you\n",
      "i give you my oath said kohlhaas to the older gentleman and sounded resolute\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "trust me frank\n",
      "you are here now and you will find your peace of mind among us\n",
      "and on the other hand there is no turning back for you anymore\n",
      "if they would ever catch you you would be liquidated immediately\n",
      "you are registered as a terrorist and a murderer in all worldwide databases of any administration and authority and a so called normal life is an illusion now\n",
      "whereby however it becomes clear at a closer look that we are the only ones who live a normal life because we are free men 73 and no slaves of this global system born of terror and oppression explained wilden with a more gently becoming voice\n",
      "l wanted to thank you again\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "whispered frank quietly\n",
      "no problem my young friend\n",
      "i am glad about the fact that alf and the others didn't let you die answered wilden with a paternal countenance\n",
      "the talk with the founder of this base took a long time and wilden became more and more kindlier\n",
      "it seemed that the older gentleman who had appeared so cold at first sight would have a fancy for frank\n",
      "since 2013 when the great crisis had shaken the entire globe and had driven millions of people into poverty destroying innumerable existences and finally even leading to famines this village had been left by its former inhabitants\n",
      "the collapse of the economy in lithuania had caused a mass exodus of young people who had been driven by the illusion to be able to find jobs in the countries of western europe\n",
      "villages like ivas which had lived on retail trade and agriculture to a large extent had just collapsed and their inhabitants had moved into the larger cities of the country or to the west\n",
      "a ghost town had finally remained and meanwhile the rural areas of eastern europe were full of abandoned villages\n",
      "thorsten wilden the former entrepreneur from westphalia had decided in 2018 when the shadows of a global dictatorship had come over the former frg to leave his homeland and to acquire houses in ivas with his last money\n",
      "wilden had already been registered as a political dissident in the databases of the secret service even at the time of the frg\n",
      "he had too often been noticeable\n",
      "when the 74 entrepreneur had stood for a political incorrect party against the frg system in 2012 the media had tried to economically ruin him with a big campaign\n",
      "the german had already thought about emigration in these days\n",
      "but he had still persevered for a while although the media had called up to boycott his company and his family had been threatened by incited fanatics\n",
      "and the situation had continued to become worse\n",
      "during the great world economic crisis the entrepreneur had lost the biggest part of his fortune and had become a target for the political police of the frg\n",
      "thereupon western and central europe had been shaken by a breakdown of the social system and racial and religious conflicts\n",
      "europe had finally been close to civil war\n",
      "in the year 2018 germany had been taken over by the world government while wilden had escaped to lithuania with his family\n",
      "he had offered the rest of his savings and had bought some of the empty houses and also a few properties in ivas for relatively small sums from the collapsing lithuanian state\n",
      "the dying national state which had been driven into complete bankruptcy by the crisis had been glad about each cent that a foreign investor had given\n",

      "only in the usa the gsa had still raged more effectively and had executed even larger parts of the population as in europe\n",
      "in this time of terror wilden had already escaped to eastern europe and had overcome the first onslaught with his family unharmedly\n",
      "however many of his political fellows of that time had disappeared in prisons or mass graves\n",

      "moreover the registration of the whole population wasn't as extensive as in the west yet\n",
      "so the strike of the world government against the nations of the world had lost a lot of its power in lithuania\n",

      "altogether he was fascinated by him\n",
      "communities of men like ivas had some more time to live in peace but the officials even pressurized the sector eastern europe more and more to create a modern system of total control\n",
      "so also in ivas strictest secrecy was increasingly necessary to survive and wilden's village had ever more problems to keep up the image of an unimportant village inhabited by some farmers\n",

      "this man was ingenious\n",
      "no question\n",
      "additionally the village community also subsisted on an own agriculture and various illegal exchanges and commercial transactions\n",

      "from this point of view they all were in a favorable situation\n",
      "it would probably just become unpleasant if an official would ever examine this place more exactly\n",

      "in these regions including india and china the scanchip had been introduced as replacement for credit and identity card a few years ago but the number of people in these countries was just too big for a close monitoring\n",

      "these regions had to be taken at first even if it wasn't always easy to conquer them\n",

      "there was no doubt if one analyzed the 81 past\n",
      "in the old age the europeans had been proud and strong and had patronized values like freedom or independence\n",
      "therefore they had to be slowly poisoned as you never attack a powerful lion directly but put it to sleep or sicken it first\n",
      "it would last a long time to describe all the procedures which had made the world to the sad place that it was today\n",
      "but it was nevertheless a cruel fact that these once great old countries were in just one hand today without exception\n",
      "the european nations crumbled decomposed and were close to total extinction\n",
      "foreign people were brought to these lands and soon all the big centers of european civilization were a puzzle of different races cultures and religions\n",
      "the international yoke of modern slavery and the imperative to consume preached by all the media of the global system was the only thing which connected them\n",
      "and this had always been the plan\n",

      "will will create the eurasian negroid future race\n",

      "if i wanted to make such a job in berlin my hometown i would come through any tunnels old underground pits or something like that said frank\n",
      "you would find a lot of tunnels in paris\n",
      "this city is more undermined than each anthill there are probably innumerable underground entrances particularly in the inner part of the city admitted wilden\n",
      "who can give me more informations about this\n",
      "these two frenchmen are nevertheless still here for a few days right\n",
      "mumbled frank\n",
      "well i hardly believe that they know every tunnel under paris\n",
      "in addition they are from the north of the country\n",

      "but you will never reach wechsler\n",
      "prophesied wilden\n",
      "but he just underestimated frank's imaginativeness and obstinacy\n",
      "only a few hours later after he had reconsidered and noted which weapons and articles of equipment had to be used for the assassination kohlhaas ran to hok and forced him to look for some plans of the underground of paris\n",
      "while frank passionately told hok his plans the computer expert just groaned because the young hotspur had disturbed him during an important work\n",
      "but then he did 112 kohlhaas the favour and entered the world of data bases and electronic construction plans\n",
      "hok fortunately was a researcher nature and after approximately half an hour he was also fascinated by his new task\n",
      "it lasted a while until he had found so informations\n",
      "paris was really more hollowed out than all the other cities in europe\n",
      "meanwhile about 16 million people lived in the metropolis and the city drowned in its own dirt and stench\n",
      "since 1850 when most of the tunnels and the comprehensive metro system had been built the old capital of france stood on a network of mile long corridors\n",
      "already in 2010 the underground system could not be extended anymore because the workers had already found old tunnels and holes everywhere\n",
      "after the world economic crisis in 2012 13 and during the following years many metro lines had been closed in consequence of substantial budget cuts\n",
      "after 2018 it had become worse what still annoyed the people of paris down to the present day\n",
      "today many old underground tunnels were unused and led into nowhere\n",
      "the tunnel system was so enormous that even official construction plans could not completely show the numerous tunnels below the city\n",
      "nevertheless hok found some interesting data bases and struggled through mountains of new informations\n",
      "the hours passed and the thick man was soon completely absent minded again\n",
      "until tomorrow i will search for some nice tunnels and corridors for you which will lead you that close to wechslefs speech desk that you can tickle his feet\n",
      "if the plans are still relevant at all i can't say frank\n",
      "and i can't give you a warranty\n",
      "much has changed in the last years\n",

      "the avenue of paris which had been called avenue de champs elysees in former times had been renamed in avenue of humanity in 2018 and the triumpal arch one of the old landmarks of the city had been torn down in 2019\n",

      "shortly afterwards they reached a nearly perfect dark back alley\n",
      "now they felt unobserved\n",
      "anyhow they could not see anybody although they looked around several times and examined the environment with sharp eyes\n",
      "a minute later they stood in front of a gully cover of iron\n",
      "it was clearly 141 visible shown on one of hok's maps of the city of paris\n",
      "they paused for a short moment\n",
      "this must be gully cover 344 gl 77003 if the map is correct said frank with a little enthusiastic face\n",
      "down there\n",
      "now\n",
      "damn\n",
      "no turning back kohlhaas\n",
      "answered alf and already screwed up his nose\n",
      "they lifted the manhole cover without problems and pushed it to the side\n",
      "in front of them an unfathomable black hole opened itself now\n",
      "only the outlines of some rusty rungs leading into the darkness could be recognized\n",
      "fuck\n",
      "said frank\n",
      "baumers nodded approvingly then he held his flashlight downward\n",
      "dirt rotten leaves and rust expected the two assassins down below\n",
      "moreover a pungent stench\n",
      "oh my god\n",
      "said kohlhaas and took his rubber gloves and the breathing mask\n",
      "do you have the blowtorch alf\n",
      "yes sure\n",
      "what are you waiting for\n",
      "muttered baumer\n",
      "frank carefully climbed down the rusty ladder while alf was shining for him\n",
      "after a few minutes he had reached the ground\n",
      "baaah\n",
      "it resounded out of the dark hole\n",
      "his partner could imagine what frank meant\n",
      "then kohlhaas shone for alf who crawled down into the unknown little inviting environment of the underground of paris\n",
      "baumer pulled the gully cover over the manhole so that only a small gap remained\n",
      "down here it was as disgusting as expected and the channel did not make the impression as if someone had ever cleaned it in the last twenty years\n",
      "wet heaps of dirt were piled up beside the rivlet down to the feet of the two men\n",
      "some rats scurried away\n",
      "alf shone at them with his flashlight and the animals quickly disappeared somewhere in a stinking hole\n",
      "142 l ook at this gentlemen of the world government are also here\n",
      "joked frank and pointed at the rats\n",
      "alf chuckled\n",
      "here will be a lot of them\n",
      "if you see a completely fat and bloated rat then you can address it with mr. world president\n",
      "frank grinned and returned to compare these poor animals with the lodge brothers is an insult for every rat\n",
      "the gossip took a bit of the uncertainty of the two rebels who stood now in the middle of an ugly sewer tunnel\n",
      "frank looked at his map again and then they walked about hundred meters straightforward\n",
      "they had to watch out for their heads because the tunnel was not as tall as a man and surely already very old\n",
      "soon after both men came to a bigger canal and heard a car above themselves\n",
      "they were under a street\n",
      "the little river of wastewater was a bit broader here just like the roundish tunnel\n",
      "now they had to come to a decision\n",
      "lf the map is correct we must go to the left said frank after a short look at the dc stick\n",
      "lt will hopefully be correct otherwise we are fucked up grumbled baumer\n",
      "there is always a gully cover somewhere that can bring us back to the surface said frank and walked forward waving with his flashlight\n",
      "meanwhile alfred sprayed a red cross on the wall in order to use it later as an orientation\n",
      "the broader sewer tunnel still extended for about two hundred meters then they came to a grid clogged with dirt and leaves which was completely rusted\n",
      "there was no getting through\n",
      "at least not without a blowtorch which alfred fortunately had\n",
      "it just took a quarter of an hour then he had destroyed the rusty lattice\n",
      "what a work\n",
      "gasped alf when the dammed up water poured away between his legs with loud splashing\n",
      "143 the tunnel with the old grid still extended for two hundred further meters then it ended in a larger room where the rills of wastewater flowed together\n",
      "gray green walls gazed at the two intruders and frank was sure that these old buildings already existed since many decades maybe since centuries\n",
      "rusty wastewater pipes came from the ceiling of the room and on the wall was a sign with something in french on it\n",
      "it was completely rusted too\n",
      "at least they could stand tall here\n",
      "the way forked again in several directions\n",
      "frank looked at some files and was sure that they had to go into the opposite tunnel alfred trusted him and sprayed another red cross on the wall\n",
      "one of these sewer corridors had not been on our map but this must be the right one\n",
      "above it is the rue de rothschild as i think explained kohlhaas\n",
      "shortly afterwards they walked through a narrow passage with some big holes in the walls\n",
      "spiders and rats welcomed them in this dark tunnel and it was smelling rancidly despite the breathing masks\n",
      "frank and alf had to crouch again and watched their heads\n",
      "meanwhile they had walked this tunnel for about fifty meters when they discovered a small source of light above themselves\n",
      "probably it was the light of one of the street lamps which came through a little hole of a gully cover\n",
      "they continued to creep through the stinking passage then they stopped\n",
      "a black water lode with a very narrow sidewalk on the side was in front of them it was approximately one meter deep\n",
      "in the distance of ten meters rusty and damaged iron pipes led upward\n",
      "alfred marked the way and followed his friend along the stream\n",
      "the water was not really deep but it smelled foul and appeared somehow threatening\n",
      "frank thought that a terrible kraken would grab them with its tentacles to pull 144 them down into a bottomless black sea\n",
      "it was just spooky down here and the stench crept out of every corner right into their noses\n",
      "lf i have counted my steps correctly we have walked about 600 or 700 meters yet said baumer\n",
      "his friend looked at the digital map and nodded\n",
      "at the end of the tunnel they reached a relatively big room which looked like a reservoir\n",
      "stairs led upward and a large pool with brackish water was in front of them\n",
      "frank illuminated the basin then he said to alfred\n",
      "\n",
      "hok's informations have mostly been correct so far\n",
      "this reservoir or whatever it is has been marked with a red spot on the map\n",
      "you should spray a sign on the wall here\n",
      "after they had crossed the next tunnel they had penetrated the underground labyrinth for more than one kilometer\n",
      "then they reached an area which reminded them of a small hall\n",
      "it must have been a part of the world famous canalization of paris which had been built in the year 1850 and during the following period\n",
      "with a tang of admiration the two men stopped for a moment and looked around\n",
      "then they continued their journey\n",
      "this must be pumps over there right\n",
      "alfred pointed at several enormous pipes with big handwheels on the side that led into a deep water reservoir\n",
      "however they also were totally rusted although they seemed to be still in use\n",
      "j think so\n",
      "answered frank\n",
      "this hall is probably in the east of the avenue of humanity\n",

      "this place is noticeable enough we don't need to mark it\n",
      "alfred put the spray can with the red color back into his backpack and followed his friend\n",
      "they went up some concrete stairs with a handrail on the side\n",
      "then they entered big room that nearly looked like an underground hall and was carried by stone columns\n",

      "alfred fetched his blowtorch but didn't destroy the door more than necessary in order to arouse no suspicion\n",
      "the tunnel beyond the locked door seemed to be endless and after a while the two men discovered a hole in the wall\n",
      "but there was no sewer corridor anywhere\n",
      "what is that\n",
      "it looks as if somebody had broken some stones out of the wall there to dig a way said frank and illuminated the strange hole with his flashlight\n",

      "they had found a sad home here in a time when there was no more room for them at the surface\n",
      "kohlhaas looked at his dc stick and read some files\n",
      "it lasted nearly half an hour\n",
      "in the meantime alfred sauntered boredly and nervously through the darkness\n",

      "150 the steel door was secured with a digital code lock\n",

      "meanwhile frank looked nervously around and hoped that nobody would disturb them\n",
      "finally the steel door opened with a quiet crunch and the two assassins came into another room which was equipped with some shelves and an electronic control desk\n",
      "the old desk reminded them of the seventies of the last century because of its design\n",
      "it was a true relict of technology\n",
      "soon after they left the area over some stone stairs and sneaked over a way with deep water reservoirs at the sides\n",

      "the avenue of humanity is no longer far\n",
      "called kohlhaas and disappeared into another dark hole\n",
      "they walked about hundred meters straightforward and turned then to the left into a further sewer corridor\n",
      "again it was one of the bigger tunnels because a small river rushed beside them here\n",
      "now they saw numerous cables rusty lamps old pipes and also a faded sign with some warnings\n",

      "alfred's blowtorch cut through the rusty metal and he threw a glowing piece of the grid into the water\n",
      "after further hundred meters a rat swarm which had probably held a meeting here fled from the blaze of their flashlights in all directions\n",

      "frank and alf were proud\n",

      "a little later it was done\n",
      "the temple of tolerance was directly above their heads\n",
      "cars were humming and honking on the heavily travelled street and they heard some people shout\n",
      "paris awoke\n",
      "152 now it was time to disappear\n",
      "frank jumped up the ladder like a cat climbed upward and lifted the gully cover to look over the square\n",

      "yes\n",
      "we will fucking do that\n",

      "occasionally frank had to study some construction plans again but mostly his sense of direction was right\n",
      "the red crosses alfred had sprayed on the walls were a good additional help\n",
      "perfectly tired stinky and filthy they finally crept out of the sewer tunnel next to the abandoned factory hall in the early morning hours\n",
      "soon they would spend many hours in the canalization again\n",
      "on their way back to the hotel at dawn no one noticed them\n",

      "at the end to the rue de york when they lurked in the shadow of an empty shop they suddenly saw a police car bending around the corner\n",
      "frank and alf were shocked nevertheless they tried to saunter inconspicuously about and acted as if they did not heed the police car\n",
      "the sound of an humming engine became louder and the tension rose to the extreme\n",
      "if just a single policeman would have asked them for their particulars or wanted to look into their backpacks then frank and alf would have had no other chance than killing him\n",
      "and in case of emergency also every other witness in sight\n",
      "no one had guns and ndc 23 by the kilo who just wanted to visit paris\n",

      "they entered the underworld again\n",
      "but this time it was no more disgusting but otherwise harmless scouting expedition\n",
      "this time it was deadly serious\n",

      "03\n",

      "or even in front of some policemen\n",
      "no there was no more room for surprises\n",
      "they had to keep their eyes open to react on changes\n",
      "now it was the same way again and rats and spiders appeared as a greeting committee in the dark tunnels once more\n",
      "when they had reached the first larger room they examined their equipment in order to be prepared for all possible incidents\n",
      "frank absently looked at his knife with the serrated blade which john throphy had organized for him on one of his trips to belarus\n",
      "then he put it back into the pocket\n",
      "the red crosses which alf had sprayed on some walls were still 162 there and the two men were glad about this\n",

      "if policemen would scan the passages before the celebrations then within this range\n",
      "they finally chose the closed metro tunnel that they could reach through the dug hole in the wall\n",
      "the air was much better here and from somewhere seemed to come a refreshing breeze\n",
      "nevertheless it was cold scary and dark there\n",

      "whispered frank\n",
      "one of us must stay awake and keep guard while the other one sleeps answered alf\n",
      "l will begin if you want\n",
      "they searched the pit for some fire wood and found all kinds of flammable waste after a few minutes\n",
      "probably it were the inheritances of some tramps\n",
      "shortly afterwards they kindled a small campfire a tiny place of warmth and light in that endless yawning pit\n",
      "kohlhaas accepted alf s offer tucked himself up and slept on the uncomfortable ground beside the rails after he had put a few dry boards and an old plastic foil there\n",
      "however this night was terrible all alone in the darkness of this old tunnel\n",
      "frank started to freeze\n",
      "two hours later his friend woke him up and asked him to take over the next night watch\n",
      "tired and nervous frank straightened up and sat down at the glowing fire\n",

      "that was the only sound in this eerie vault and kohlhaas was happy to hear it after a while\n",

      "163 it was at 6\n",
      "00 o'clock in the morning\n",
      "frank and alfred had a pitiful breakfast and started with their reconnaissance\n",
      "they slunk quietly and slowly forward and still did not see anybody at this early time\n",
      "no grids or barricades had been repaired by any workers or had been placed by the police\n",

      "on 27\n",
      "02\n",
      "2029 the two men played card games or spent their time with various conversations at the campfire in the closed metro tunnel\n",
      "later they explored some new passages and finally returned to their hiding place\n",
      "they preferred the old metro tunnel to the canalization\n",
      "not only because of the better air and the campfire\n",
      "apart from the bigger halls with the water reservoirs the narrow canals were no places where they wanted to stay longer than necessary\n",
      "the hours seemed to be endless down below in the underground of paris\n",
      "again a long and uncomfortable night was waiting for them and frank decided to be on guard at first while alfred tried to sleep\n",
      "kohlhaas was also very tired and nibbled boredly on some chips from the supermarket\n",
      "meanwhile the darkness around him made the young man more nervous than ever before and so he decided to look for some more wood for the campfire\n",
      "soon he had discovered another pile of broads near the tracks\n",
      "after a while he cowered at the campfire again but suddenly he startled up\n",
      "something had shown its head in a dark corner beyond the pile of firewood\n",
      "it had been a ghostly pale child pressing its finger to the lips as if it wanted to remind frank to be silent\n",
      "pssst\n",
      "he thought to have heard\n",
      "then the darkness returned again\n",
      "he felt the adrenaline burning in his veins\n",

      "nothing at all\n",
      "after two hours frank was damn glad about the fact that he could hand over the night watch to alfred now\n",
      "then he immediately fell asleep\n",
      "when it was his turn again in the early morning he initially illuminated the strange place with his flashlight\n",
      "but there were no ghosts at all only garbage\n",
      "franks nerves were raw and he started to search more thoroughly\n",
      "but it must have been an illusion\n",
      "shortly afterwards the young man left the spooky place and hoped that the panic would die down again\n",
      "the fire flickered and fought against its extinction for a while\n",
      "finally kohlhaas had to return to the eerie corner to bring some more firewood\n",
      "he was still scared and looked around waiting for the coming of the ghostly child\n",

      "damn\n",

      "alf jumped up and crawled through the hole in the wall into the sewer corridor\n",
      "he ran to a bifurcation and went into the next passage\n",
      "in his corner of his eye he could see one of the red crosses he had sprayed on the wall before\n",
      "the voices became louder\n",
      "they probably came from the larger hall with the control room\n",
      "after some minutes alf had 165 advanced far enough into the tangle of sewers corridors and had reached the room with the water basins\n",
      "again he heard someone call in french\n",
      "he turned off his flashlight and disappeared in the darkness\n",
      "then he sneaked towards to the source of noise\n",
      "someone had put on the lights in the hall and the old high vault was weakly illuminated now\n",
      "baumer dared not to go further and huddled in a corner of the corridor which led to the hall\n",
      "the voices still became a little louder and came out of the small room beside the hall which could be reached over the stairs\n",
      "finally a man came out of the chamber and called his colleague\n",
      "these men were workers of the public utilities of paris and made their daily inspection round here\n",
      "alf hoped that they would not come too often\n",
      "after he had observed them for a while and one the workers had examined a water basin the two men walked away and disappeared into a sewer corridor\n",
      "alf heard them talk loudly\n",
      "then their voices faded away in the distance\n",
      "the rebel turned around and sneaked again towards the closed metro tunnel\n",
      "l just hope they haven't noticed that we have opened those grids and that steel door he said quietly to himself\n",
      "but the workers had made a calm impression\n",
      "this was obviously just an usual inspection round that they made repeatedly and with not much eagerness\n",
      "and even if they would repair something frank and alfred could still destroy it in the next night again\n",
      "kohlhaas was waiting at the small campfire and was relieved when he saw alfred creeping through the hole in the wall\n",
